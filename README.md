# Luanti mod "mcl_xp_bottles"
Adds XP Bottles to [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) game [Mineclonia](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ryvnf/mineclonia/)

# Mineclonia code reuse
This mod reuses some functionality from Mineclonia for throwing the XP bottles
This might break the mods compatibility with the game sometime in the future.
